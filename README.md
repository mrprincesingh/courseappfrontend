> ✨ABOUT Project AND THEIR RULES🧑‍💻

⬇️To access the application, please follow these steps:

⭕ Start the Backend Server:
Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory of the project. Use the following command to start the backend server:

  ✨ npm run dev
   
This command will initialize the backend server, allowing it to handle incoming requests.

⭕ Start the Frontend Application:
Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory of the project. Use the following command to start the frontend application:

   ✨npm start
  
Once executed, the frontend application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

⭕ User Registration and Login:
You can sign up as a user by providing your registration details. Additionally, you can log in as an administrator, but please note that the administrator credentials are hardcoded. The credentials are as follows:

Email: [Administrator's Email]
Password: [Administrator's Password]

⭕ User Functionality:
As a user, you have access to various features, including viewing and editing your profile. You can also access all available courses after subscribing and making payments through the integrated Razorpay payment gateway.

⭕ Admin Functionality:
Administrators have similar access to user features but cannot purchase subscriptions since they already have administrative privileges. Admins have a separate dashboard where they can monitor user activity, add, delete, and edit courses and lectures, and change user roles.

This application provides a seamless experience for both users and administrators, allowing them to interact with courses and manage user-related tasks efficiently.

Please note that for security reasons, it's essential to use strong and unique passwords and avoid hard-coding sensitive credentials in a production environment. Additionally, consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to enhance the security of your application.
